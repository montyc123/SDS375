**Details and Source**<br>
This dataset contains data on a sample of 1450 birth records from 2001 that statistician John Holcomb at Cleveland State University selected from the North Carolina State Center for Health and Environmental Statistics.

The dataset has 1450 observations on 15 variables.

## Some real-world examples

Let's review three datasets on Kaggle:

- [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)

- [Pokemon](https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon)

- [Women's E-Commerce Clothing Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/nicapotato/womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews)

## Working with missing values in R

---

## R propagates missingness

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, NA, 4)

sum(x)
```

--

```{r}
mean(x)
```

--

```{r}
x == 2
```


---

## Many functions allow explicit exclusion of `NA` values

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, NA, 4)

sum(x, na.rm = TRUE)
```

--

```{r}
mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
```

--

But is this the right thing to do?

---

## There is no general right or wrong approach

```{r}
x <- c(2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, NA, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2)
mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
```

--

```{r}
x <- c(NA, NA, NA, 2, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 1, NA, NA, NA, NA)
mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
```

--

R's default is conservative: If there's at least one `NA`, the result is `NA`

---

## We need to use `is.na()` to check for missing values

.small-font[
```{r}
c(1, 2, NA, 4) == NA   # does not work
is.na(c(1, 2, NA, 4))  # works
```
]

---

## There are several missing values of different types

- `NA`: logical constant indicating missing value

- `NA_integer_`: missing integer

- `NA_real_`: missing real

- `NA_complex_`: missing complex value

- `NA_character_`: missing string


---

## Sometimes the type matters

```{r}
c(1, 2, NA)
c(1, 2, NA_real_)
c(1, 2, NA_character_)
```

---

## Sometimes the type matters

```{r}
typeof(c(1, 2, NA))
typeof(c(1, 2, NA_real_))
typeof(c(1, 2, NA_character_))
```

---

## Replacing `NA` values with something else

Remember from class on data wrangling:

.small-font[
```{r, message = FALSE}
band_data <- full_join(band_members, band_instruments)
band_data
```
]

---

## Replacing `NA` values with something else

Replace `NA`s with empty strings in `plays` column:

.small-font[
```{r}
band_data %>%
  mutate(plays = replace_na(plays, ""))
```
]


---

## Replacing `NA` values with something else

Replace `NA`s with empty strings in all columns:

.small-font[
```{r}
band_data %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), ~replace_na(.x, "")))
```
]

---

## Replacing things with `NA` values

Replace empty strings with `NA` in `plays` column (requires **naniar** package):

.small-font[
```{r}
band_data %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), ~replace_na(.x, ""))) %>%
  replace_with_na_at("plays", ~.x == "")
```
]

---

## Replacing things with `NA` values

Replace empty strings with `NA` in all columns (requires **naniar** package):

.small-font[
```{r}
band_data %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), ~replace_na(.x, ""))) %>%
  replace_with_na_all(~.x == "")
```
]

---

## Removing rows with `NA` values

Remove all rows with any `NA`s with `na.omit()`:

.small-font[
```{r}
band_data %>%
  na.omit()
```
]

---

## Removing rows with `NA` values

Remove all rows where specific columns contain `NA`s:

.small-font[
```{r}
band_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(plays))
```
]

---

## Removing rows with `NA` values

Conversely:

.small-font[
```{r}
band_data %>%
  filter(is.na(plays))
```
]

---

## Visualizing `NA`s

.small-font.pull-left.width-40[
```{r NCbirths-plot-missing, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(NCbirths) +
  aes(Weeks, Gained) +
  geom_point()
```

By default, missing points are not shown
]

.pull-right.xtiny-font.width-55[
```{r NCbirths-plot-missing-out, ref.label = "NCbirths-plot-missing", echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.width = (.618*6/.75), fig.height = 0.618*6, dev = "svg"}
```
]


---

## Visualizing `NA`s

.small-font.pull-left.width-40[
```{r NCbirths-plot-missing2, eval = FALSE}
library(naniar)

ggplot(NCbirths) +
  aes(Weeks, Gained) +
  geom_miss_point()
```

Can show them with the **naniar** package
]

.pull-right.xtiny-font.width-55[
```{r NCbirths-plot-missing2-out, ref.label = "NCbirths-plot-missing2", echo = FALSE, out.width = "95%", fig.width = 6, fig.height = 0.618*6, dev = "svg"}
```
]
